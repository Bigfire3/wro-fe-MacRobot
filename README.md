This repository contains all important files and information about our autonomous driving car "MacRobot" (comes from the TV series MacGyver. As a base/microcontroller we chose the Lego Mindstorms EV3, which we equipped with the PixyCam CMUcam5 V1 (Lego Mindstorms version) for object recognition. The reasons for choosing the EV3 were the high reliability as well as the already existing knowledge and experience with the system from Lego incl. programming. We developed the program for the regional competition, which took place for us in Schweinfurt, in the Lego software based on LabView. The software ran on an EV3 brick with the original Lego Mindstorms EV3 firmware. For the Germany finals, we went a step further and tried to program the EV3 brick based on the ev3dev firmware using Python. Hope was increased flexibility and versatility, but reliability was lacking. For the German finals we did without any modifications on the car. For the world final in Dortmund, we modified the robot a bit to reach higher speeds. Going faster also meant some changes in the software.

**program structure**
The programs changed a lot over the three rounds of competition. As mentioned earlier, we used Lego software based on LabView in the beginning. For the German finals, the goal was to complete the races with Python programs. We did not succeed in this, which meant that during the competition we reverted to .ev3, which was already working. For the world finals, we relied on improved Python programs. However, the program structure always remained the same. Since we use different sensors for the two race modes, we created a script for the race without obstacles (for world finals see "/Programmcode/Python/non-obstacles.py") as well as a script for the obstacle race (for world finals see "/Programmcode/Python/obstacles.py"). We also wrote a module (initially "libraryFE", now "/Programmcode/Python/felib.py") which contains important functions for "obstacles" and "non-obstacles". Example is the myPID class, which provides a PID controller and calculates motor values from setpoints and actual values.

**motors/sensors**
The MacRobot was driven by a Lego EV3 medium motor via the rear axle with differential (better cornering). For steering, we also used a Lego EV3 Medium motor connected to a steering device. To make the bot drive as straight as possible, we initially installed a Lego gyro sensor, which was reset after the start and then measured the turning position. Furthermore, a Lego color sensor detects if a colored line is crossed. This is useful for counting sections and stopping after three laps on the one hand, and initiating a turn on the other. Before an obstacle race, we mount the aforementioned PixyCam to drive around the red and green obstacles. We were not able to distinguish the thick and colored lines from the obstacles with the camera and to evaluate them in a meaningful way to do without a color sensor. During a race without obstacles, the robot also orientates itself with the help of two Lego ultrasonic sensors, which measure the distances to the walls. For a higher speed, we installed a Lego EV3 Large motor with transmission after the German final.

**software**
We programmed the .ev3 in Lego's own LabView environment and the .py in Microsoft Visual Studio Code with the ev3dev extension. The 3D model, engineering drawing, and electrical component representation were created in Autodesk Fusion 360. We created the design for our t-shirts in Photoshop and later had them printed in our home town.

**about us**
We come from Chemnitz, the gateway to the Ore Mountains, and our names are Lenny Stelzmann and Fabian ZÃ¤nker. Ever since we met in the 5th grade, we have been enthusiastic about technology and computer science. Besides assembling and programming robots, we regularly go bouldering together. Bouldering is a special kind of climbing where you don't use a safety rope. I, Fabian, like to fill my free time with windsurfing on the lake. I, Lenny, spend my time on the lake fishing. We both spend a lot of time on our self-built computers, creatively helping each other with various projects and constantly learning something new. We came to the WRO competition through a robotics club that was offered at our school. Due to the Corona pandemic, many competitions were cancelled. So we were even more excited when we heard about the new Future Engineers category. This category, in which you have to design autonomous driving cars, appealed to us directly and made us curious. Currently we are students of the 12th grade in Chemnitz and work (hard) on our Abitur. We would like to thank our sponsor "maker e.V.", who made it possible for us to print our own team shirts.
